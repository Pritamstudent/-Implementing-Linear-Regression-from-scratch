# -Implementing-Linear-Regression-from-scratch
## Work Flow:
- First we will set the learning rate and number of iterations.
- Then, we will build the Linear Regression Equation.
- Find the y_pred value to find the weight and the bias
- Evaluate the loss function
- Update the parameter values using gradient descent.
- Finally, we will get the best model.
## Performance of the model
- To check the performance of the model, we took a simple data-set which had work-experience and salary as the columns.
- Then, we loaded the data into pandas dataframe.
- We then performed exploratory data analysis.
- Then, we split the data-set.
- Finally we trained the model and plotted the predicted values against actual values.
